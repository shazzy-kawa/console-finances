# console-finances

## Description


This weeks challenge was to use the starter file to create a financial analysis. This was to use all the current javascript knowledge I know to perform different calculations from an array. i have learnt how to calculate the lengths of an array, to sum up an array, to perform iterations, to use functions and to round a number.

## Usage

To see how the page performs, click on the console to see the financial analysis.
